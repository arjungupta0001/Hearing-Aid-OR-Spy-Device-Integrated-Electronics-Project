# Hearing-Aid-OR-Spy-Device-Integrated-Electronics-Project
A pocket listening device that can pick up very faint or remote sounds and amplify them. It maintains a constant level at the output i.e. the faint sounds should be amplified and the strong signals to be attenuated to a certain level which is considered to be safe. It should use BJT for amplification and attenuation.
The Project Poster contains images of the circuit and the circuit diagram, which has the values of the components written alongside.
The Problem Statement contains all the specifications of the circuit designed.
